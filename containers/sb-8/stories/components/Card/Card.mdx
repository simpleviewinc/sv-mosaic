## Examples
### Base
A simple way to display encapsulated, itemized information to the user. In it's simplest form, it is a bordered box
with a heading area containing a title.
<Canvas of={examples.Base} />
### TopActions
Provide a list of buttons that should be displayed in the card's header area. The buttons will be horizontally aligned
to the right, vertically aligned center with the title and rendered within a `ButtonRow` component.
### BottomActions
Provide a list of buttons that should be displayed below the card's content. The buttons will be horizontally aligned
in the center and rendered within a `ButtonRow` component.
### TitleIcon
You can provide a MUI icon component (or any component, really) to the `titleIcon` property and it will be comfortably
rendered before the title with a small gap in between.
### Count
By providing a number to the `count` property, you can have the value displayed appropriately alongside the title of the
card. The number will be displayed in brackets in a slightly smaller font than the title. To avoid displaying the number
if it is "0", you can provide the `displayZeroCount` property as `false`.
