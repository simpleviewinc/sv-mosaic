# Drawers
The `Drawers` component is wrapper that generates several [Material-UI Drawers](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-drawer/#main-content) but with SimpleView brand colors.

The component does not provide a mechanism for navigating between drawers, it only helps stacking one on top of another.
All the navgitation mechanism should be defined on the parent app creating the Drawers component.

* While animating, the UI is locked to prevent race conditions with opening/closing new drawers.
* Can open infinite amount of stacked drawers.
* When a drawer is opened, the opener passes callbacks to it to execute when save() is clicked.
* Animations custom built via keyframes rather than using material-ui drawer defaults to handle stacking cleanly.
* App passes to Drawers a JSON Def for each drawer and passes a render prop. This separates the concerns of animating and displaying the drawer (Mosaic) from rendering the content of the drawer (App).

## Usage
```ts
const App = (props) => {
	const [state, setState] = useState<AppState>({
		content: {},
		drawers: [],
	});

	const addDrawer = useCallback((drawerDef: DrawerDef) => {
		setState((state) => ({
			...state,
			drawers: [...state.drawers, drawerDef],
		}));
	}, []);

	const removeDrawer = useCallback(() => {
		setState((state) => ({
			...state,
			drawers: [...state.drawers.slice(0, -1)],
		}));
	}, []);

	const appContext = useMemo(
		() => ({
			addDrawer,
			removeDrawer,
		}),
		[addDrawer, removeDrawer]
	);

	return (
		<AppContext.Provider value={appContext}>
			<div className="App">
				<h1>Drawer Demo</h1>
				<p>From Form: {JSON.stringify(state.content)}</p>
				<button
					onClick={() =>
						addDrawer({
							config: {
								type: "form",
								title: "New Form",
								fields: [
									{
										name: "foo",
										label: "Foo",
										type: "text",
									},
									{

										label: "Bar",
										type: "text",
									},
									{

										label: "Baz",
										type: "text",
									},
									{
										name: "from_parent",
										label: "From Parent",
										type: "text",
									},
								],
							},
							callbacks: {
								save: (data) => {
									setState((state) => ({
										...state,
										content: data,
									}));

									removeDrawer();
								},
							},
						})
					}
				>
					Add Form
				</button>

				<Drawers drawers={state.drawers}>
					{(drawerDef) => {
						return (
							<Page
								config={drawerDef.config}
								callbacks={drawerDef.callbacks ?? {}}
							/>
						);
					}}
				</Drawers>
			</div>
		</AppContext.Provider>
	);
