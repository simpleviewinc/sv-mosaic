# LeftNav

`LeftNav` renders a left navigation drawer based on the items passed to it.

The `LeftNav` has 4 variants for it's display.

* `full` - Displays a permanent left navigation fixed to the left side of the screen.
* `icons_only` - Displays only the icons for the top-level items/groups to reduce space.
* `hidden` - Navigation will display via a hamburger menu trigger from the top bar.
* `mobile` - Hamburger triggered, but will utilize a sequential navigation style instead of hover/flyout optimized for smaller screen sizes.

## Types of Links

* The default link, when clicked, will execute the primary `onNav` function passed to `LeftNav`. This is useful in most cases where you want standard single-page-app style navigation.
* If your app allows incoming links via URL, in example if I can visit https://your.app/nav_item/ and that will load /nav_item/ then it is recommended you add `attrs.href : "/nav_item/"` to that `LeftNavItemDef`. This provides a better UX because it allows users to open `LeftNav` links in a new window or copy that link without visiting it.
* If you have links that are simply out-going links, you can pass `attrs.href` and `onNav : false` to disable the normal onNav processing. It will now just be a normal HTML anchor tag. If you want it to open in a new window pass `attrs.target : "_blank"`.
* There are rare cases where you may a specific nav item to have it's own `onNav` handler to reduce complexity in your main `onNav` handler. In this situation you can pass your own `onNav` on the `LeftNavItemDef`. When clicked, the system will automatically call the `item.onNav` and then `LeftNavProps.onClose`, this way you don't have to handle closing the navigation in your custom handler.

## Important Things to Do

* Regardless of `variant` active the `LeftNav` should be placed in the DOM tree in a position that fixes it to the left side of the screen. When in `full` or `icons_only` it will fill it's container. You do not need to move it to a different location for `hidden` or `mobile`, the material-ui drawer system will handle this for you.
* The user has the capability to choose between `full`, `icons_only` and `hidden` via a toggle in the navigation itself. Your application should determine when to use the user's chosen setting vs `mobile` based on your own criteria. In the test application we use the criteria that the width is smaller than `1024`. When your application utilizes the mobile variant should depend on when the main area of your product becomes too cramped to have a permanent navigation. This might be a different breakpoint for different projects.
* When `mobile` variant engages you should not change the user's chosen behavior, instead you should override it. In example, if the user's chosen setting is `icons_only` and the user shrinks their browser to mobile size, if they make it larger again it should return to `icons_only`.
* It is recommended you persist the user's chosen `variant`. This can be via a cookie, localStorage, or account-based mechanics.
* In `mobile` and `hidden` variants, you will need a hamburger in your top bar to trigger the opening of the navigation. This should not be present in the `full` or `icons_only` variants.
* In your `onVariantChange` you will want to toggle the `open` state to false. This ensures that if a user alters the variant, it doesn't leave the nav open.
* In your `onNav` you will want to toggle the `open` state to false. If you are doing dynamic page changes you will want to scroll to the top of the content div.
* If your app is doing dynamic page changes and you are supporting browser back mechanics, you will need to ensure you pass the proper `active` value into the LeftNav component. On a back you will likely want to also set `open` to false.
* In order to ensure the `LeftNav` works properly on iOS12 and older devices you will need to have a noop `onClick` on the root element of your application. Without an empty function on your root div, the click away listener will not function properly.
