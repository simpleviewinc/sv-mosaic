# Toggle

The `Toggle` component is built over a wrapper for [MUI Switch](https://mui.com/material-ui/react-switch/#main-content) but with SimpleView brand colors.

- Toggle Switch allow users to switch between two possible states. They are commonly used to turn a specific setting on or off
- Toggles should be used to turn on or off a preference, notification, or feature
- Should be used when an instant response is required/desired
