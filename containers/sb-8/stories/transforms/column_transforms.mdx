# Transforms

Transforms are helper functions you can pass to the `DataView` columns which will tweak the data in common ways. You can pass multiple transforms to chain them together.

Mosaic provides a variety of core transforms that you can see in the left nav.

If you want to create your own transforms, pass a function which matches the [DataViewColumnTransform](https://github.com/simpleviewinc/sv-mosaic/blob/develop/containers/mosaic/src/components/DataView/DataViewTypes.ts) interface.

```js
import { DataView } from "#mosaic";
function myComponent(props) {
    const config = [
        ...
        columns : [
            {
                name : "test",
                label : "Test",
                transforms : [
                    TRANSFORMS
                ]
            }
        ]
    ]

    return (
        <DataView
            {...config}
        />
    )
}
```
