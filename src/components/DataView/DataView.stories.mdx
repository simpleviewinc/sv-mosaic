# DataView

A `DataView` is used to output a list or grid of items. It can support a whole variety of actions including primary actions, additional actions and bulk actions.

## Props
* **title** -  `string` - The title of the DataView.
* **columns** - `array` of `object`
    * **name** - `string` - Unique name for this column.
    * **column** - `string` - defaults to `${column.name}` - When a column is displayed we need to know the name of the key in the data object that should populate this. By default `name` works. In some cases you might need to use the same data key but display it in multiple ways, you can use `column` for that purpose.
    * **label** - `string` - The displayed label of the column.
    * **style** - `object` - Style the content of the cell in a specific way(s).
        * **bold** - `boolean` - **Bold** the cell.
        * **italic** - `boolean` - *Italicize* the cell.
        * **strikeThrough** - `boolean` - ~~Strike~~ through the cell.
        * **noWrap** - `boolean` - Prevent the column's contents from wrapping to multiple lines.
        * **ellipsis** - `boolean` - Truncate the content if it gets too long. When using this you will need to also enable `noWrap` and `maxWidth`. When truncated, the content will be available in the `title` attribute automatically.
        * **maxWidth** - `boolean` - Limit the widget of the column to a specific width, pass CSS like `maxWidth : "50px"`.
    * **sortable** - `boolean` - Whether the column is sortable by the user.
    * **transforms** - `array of functions` - Functions which will receive the data from the column, manipulate the value, and then return it. An example of a transformation would be converting a JS `Date` object into a user-friendly string or converting boolean `true` to string `Yes`.
        * [Transforms documentation](?path=/docs/utils-transforms-readme--page)

* **loading** - `boolean` - Pass `true` when your DataView is fetching data or doing some alteration which needs to lock the UI. While `loading` is true, the majority of the UI elements in the DataView are locked to prevent race conditions. Once the data has been fetched you will want to prop down `false` again.
* **onSkipChange** - `function({ skip })` - A callback that will be executed with the new skip selected by the user.
* **onSortChange** - `function({ name, dir })` - A callback function which is invoked when the sort of the `DataView` is changed. Returns a data object listing the chosen sort column and direction.

* **onSavedViewSave** - `function` - A callback function which is invoked when a saved view is saved. This function will be passed a data object containing the view information.

* **onSavedViewGetOptions** - `function` -  A callback function which is used to provide an array of views to the SavedView component. Useful when loading a list of saved views from a user profile.
* **savedViewAllowSharedViewSave** - `boolean` - default false - A value which controls the `Show for all Users` toggle on the `Save View` drawer.

## Actions

Actions are the tool for giving your user a way to alter/interact with a specific row or rows within your list view. In `sv-mosaic` there are 3 types of actions: bulkActions, primaryActions and additionalActions.

* **primaryActions** - Buttons that display on each row, which are displayed to all users. You will want to use this for your frequently one or two most used actions. If you have too many primary actions then the UI can get bulky and likely some should be moved into `additionalActions`.
* **additionalActions** - Menu items which display underneath the "..." on each row in the list view.
* **bulkActions** - When users utilize the checkboxes on the rows, it will bring up bulkActions so that they can perform them on all actions.
